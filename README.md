## Tech Stack


MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) is another popular full stack
development. It is usually considered as an alternative to MEAN stack
development. Below is the architecture of MERN:

**MongoDB** - Database layer

**ExpressJS** - Middleware for Nodejs

**ReactJS** - Front end (User Interface)

**Node.js** - Web server logic

The main difference between MERN and MEAN stack is Angular and
React. Both Angular and React does the job for your requirement. Its
personal choice which one to use. Before learning MERN stack
development, we should have knowledge of HTML/CSS, JavaScript,
React JS, Node JS.
